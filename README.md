This is my learning plan repository which includes Git and Python exercises, progress reflections, and journal entries.

#Day 1: figuring the gitlab and everything included
This is my first day and i struggled with creating a repository and i've been doing my research on how to create it. I managed to figure it out but i'm trying to figure out if this read me journal includes creating our first commit and if this counts as our first commit(confused Neo but determined Neo). I'm NOT giving up just yet.
