#CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python

This repository contains my work for HarvardX‚Äôs CS50 Python course. As someone new to coding, I‚Äôm using this space to learn, experiment, and grow through each module.

# Course Scope
The course introduces foundational programming concepts, including:
- Functions and logic
- Conditional statements and loops
- File handling and libraries
- Object-oriented programming basics
- Testing and error management
- Regular expressions and input validation

# Repository Layout:
-  Weekly coding assignments and exercises
-  Final project and optional builds
-  Personal notes, course insights, and reflections

# Goals
I‚Äôm taking this course to build a solid understanding of Python and programming fundamentals. This journey will help prepare me for the WeThinkCode_ software engineering program and future tech projects.

# Tools
- Python 3
- CS50 IDE
- Git and GitHub

# Progress
Currently in progress. I‚Äôll be adding new files and updates as I complete each lesson.

# Day 1 and 2

I spent most if not both day figuring the GitHub and how to submit. The codespace kept crashing and shutting down which had me frustrated but i had to calm down. Once i had figured how to link and push my projects into my cs50 submit50 and GitHub,the only thing that got on my nerves was the codespace sonce it kept crashing and once it worked then the terminal is not workingüò©but nevertheless i digress,I'm so happy that i figured how to submit and checkü•π

# Day 7 to Day 9

i've been having a hard time pushing my work from my me50 folder so i just saw it fit to just download the zip and upload it to this file since i can't push it or make it public and now i have to figure out the GitLab work that has to be uploaded here also so those are my challenges as of now because my me50 is connected to my CS50 on edx so when i check and submit,it does automaticallyüëçüèæ
