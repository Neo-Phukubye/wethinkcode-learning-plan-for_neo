# wethinkcode-learning-plan-for_neo
This is my learning plan repository which includes Git and Python exercises, progress reflections, and journal entries.
#CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python

This repository contains my work for HarvardX’s CS50 Python course. As someone new to coding, I’m using this space to learn, experiment, and grow through each module.

# Course Scope
The course introduces foundational programming concepts, including:
- Functions and logic
- Conditional statements and loops
- File handling and libraries
- Object-oriented programming basics
- Testing and error management
- Regular expressions and input validation

# Repository Layout:
-  Weekly coding assignments and exercises
-  Final project and optional builds
-  Personal notes, course insights, and reflections

# Goals
I’m taking this course to build a solid understanding of Python and programming fundamentals. This journey will help prepare me for the WeThinkCode_ software engineering program and future tech projects.

# Tools
- Python 3
- CS50 IDE
- Git and GitHub

# Progress
Currently in progress. I’ll be adding new files and updates as I complete each lesson.

# Day 1 and 2

I spent most if not both day figuring the GitHub and how to submit. The codespace kept crashing and shutting down which had me frustrated but i had to calm down. Once i had figured how to link and push my projects into my cs50 submit50 and GitHub,the only thing that got on my nerves was the codespace sonce it kept crashing and once it worked then the terminal is not working😩but nevertheless i digress,I'm so happy that i figured how to submit and check🥹

# Day 3 to 4

I've managed to do all of my week 0 work but i habe to go and get my license in gauteng since i am in Mpumalanga right now. i've been here taking care of my grandmother since my grandpa passed on so i'll be leaving my laptop but i will be in Gauteng for a couple days.

# Day 5 

We had our group call and honestly i enjoy my group and our performance manager since he also did a career change like i am now so it doesn't feel as hard anymore. i've doing my research and doing my work for like 15 hours per day since i don't have anything to do besides taking care of my grandmother. it seems like most people in our cohort whatsap groupchat are people who know what they are doing and more experience but i understand that this is a personal journey.

# Day 7 to Day 9

i've been having a hard time pushing my work from my me50 folder so i just saw it fit to just download the zip and upload it to this file since i can't push it or make it public and now i have to figure out the GitLab work that has to be uploaded here also so those are my challenges as of now because my me50 is connected to my CS50 on edx so when i check and submit,it does automatically👍🏾i just figured that my Git work is me creating a license for my neo25-rgb project and not some work i'll find in a folder and i have to code or solve(🤦🏾i mean that is what was required and i was busy on gitlab looking for a folder with demo and exercises)

# Day 10
I feel so conflicted and I don't know what I did wrong😭my GitHub suggested that I should configure my repository and it has shown a red x on top and I don't know what is wrong with it. I'll figure it out tomorrow,how to delete and what not because I have been trying to rerun and debug my mistake🙆🏾‍♀️yoh,we truly live and we learn. Yeah😂I managed to fix it💃🏾guess what using coding😌💃🏾

# Day 11 -27
I keep forgetting to add things here🙆🏾‍♀️my cohort have been tutoring us(those who don't have experience) and also sometimes it is challenging like you just need to close your laptop because it is giving you and error and you are frustrated. The mistake could be a simple error and you could be stuck on the same thing for days and you watch videos whilst trying to retain information. Honestly this is quite a ride sometimes and then it is rewarding. You'll do your research and go down a rabbit hole😩Honestly,I don't even know what or which week I'm on like am I behind or am I forward. I do like how this has consumed my time.
